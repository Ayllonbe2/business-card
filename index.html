           <p>I began my journey in science with a strong foundation in Biochemistry, which initially shaped my analytical thinking and attention to detail. After completing my degree, I discovered a passion for technology and its potential to transform our understanding of the world. This led me to pursue a Master's in Bioinformatics—a field that allowed me to blend my scientific background with cutting-edge computational methods.</p>
           <p>Building on this interdisciplinary approach, I went on to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science. Throughout my academic career, I explored topics related to digital transformation and artificial intelligence, gaining insights into how technology can drive innovation. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work for five years in research, where I honed my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of complex systems. More recently, I have spent four years in the industry, applying these insights to practical challenges in digitalization and AI.</p>
           <p>I am passionate about staying at the forefront of technological advancements and continually seek out new methods to add tangible value to the projects I work on. I see every challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow, and I thrive when I'm exploring areas that are new to me. My approach is focused on proactive problem-solving—finding solutions rather than dwelling on problems or assigning blame.</p>
           <p>Ultimately, I believe that the integration of scientific rigor with technological innovation can lead to transformative breakthroughs. I am committed to leveraging my diverse background to drive progress and create meaningful impact wherever I work.</p>
